# This is a projet that i did in the 42 school 

My object here is to redo the project with ansible, and to go deeper into the configuration of the services, the ultimate objectif is to have a role to deploy the web server.  

This project is still not finished, and the playbooks i've already made can be improved to have more modulable and flexible ones, this will be done in the long term.
